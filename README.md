# Flutter UI Challenge 2: Slack

I decided to hone my Flutter UI skills and took it upon myself to find stunning application designs and try to recreate them as best as I can. It's a long journey but I feel with every design I recreate my skills in crafting beautiful designs increases too

## Design recreated
This recreation is from the Slack Homepage, a communications platform for teams. You can find the designs on [dribble](https://mobbin.com/apps/slack-ios-52e4ce57-0a3d-45b8-a1ab-6f83ec186105?utm_source=copy_link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=app_sharing)
